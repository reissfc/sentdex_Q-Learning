Hello and welcome to the first video about Deep Q-Learning and Deep Q Networks, or DQNs. Deep Q Networks are the deep learning/neural network versions of Q-Learning.

With DQNs, instead of a Q Table to look up values, you have a model that you inference (make predictions from), and rather than updating the Q table, you fit (train) your model.
